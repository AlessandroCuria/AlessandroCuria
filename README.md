## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alessandro.
I'm a software developer based in Milan, Italy. While my primary focus is backend development with Springboot and Laravel, I often find myself wearing many hats to ensure the project's success. Whether it's managing cloud infrastructure, data analysis, frontend development or CI/CD, I'm always ready to tackle whatever needs to be done.

When I'm not programmingâ€¦

...you'll often find me in the mountains or out sailing, aiming to keep a healthy work-life balance. I enjoy discovering new trails, immersing myself in nature, and finding inspiration in the stunning scenery around me.
